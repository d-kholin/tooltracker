# Tool Fields Migration Guide

## Overview

This update adds three new optional fields to the tools table:
- **Brand** - The manufacturer/brand of the tool
- **Model Number** - The specific model number of the tool
- **Serial Number** - The unique serial number of the tool

These fields are optional and will be automatically added to existing databases when the application starts.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Tool Information
- Tools now include brand, model number, and serial number fields
- These fields are displayed in the tool detail view
- All fields are optional and can be left blank

### 2. Improved Search Functionality
- Search now includes the new fields (brand, model number, serial number)
- Users can search for tools by any of these identifiers
- Search is case-insensitive and works with partial matches

### 3. Better Tool Organization
- Tools can now be categorized and identified more precisely
- Useful for insurance purposes and tool identification
- Helps with warranty claims and tool tracking

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration (Recommended)
The new fields are automatically added when you start the application. The migration:
- Checks if the new columns exist
- Adds missing columns if needed
- Preserves all existing data
- Is safe to run multiple times

### Manual Migration (Optional)
If you prefer to run the migration manually, you can use the provided script:

```bash
python migrate_tools.py
```

This script will:
- Create a backup of your database
- Add the new columns
- Provide detailed feedback on the process

## Database Schema Changes

The tools table now includes these additional columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tools ADD COLUMN brand TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tools ADD COLUMN model_number TEXT;
ALTER TABLE tools ADD COLUMN serial_number TEXT;
```

## User Interface Updates

### Add Tool Form
- New fields are displayed in a responsive grid layout
- Placeholder text provides examples for each field
- All fields are optional

### Edit Tool Form
- Existing values are pre-populated in the form
- Users can update any of the new fields
- Form maintains the same user experience

### Tool Detail View
- New fields are displayed when they contain values
- Clean, organized layout shows all available information
- Fields are only shown if they have content

## Search Enhancements

The search functionality now searches across:
- Tool name
- Description
- Brand
- Model number
- Serial number
- Current borrower

This makes it easier to find tools using any identifying information.

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing tools will continue to work normally
- New fields will be NULL for existing tools
- No data loss occurs during migration
- Existing search functionality remains unchanged

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
If you encounter migration problems:

1. Check that the database file is writable
2. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for the backup
3. Verify the database file path is correct

### Field Not Showing
If new fields don't appear:

1. Restart the application to trigger migration
2. Check the console for migration messages
3. Verify the database columns were added successfully

## Support

For issues or questions about the migration:
1. Check the application console for error messages
2. Verify the database file permissions
3. Ensure the application has write access to the database directory

## Future Enhancements

These new fields enable future features such as:
- Brand-based filtering and reporting
- Model-specific maintenance schedules
- Serial number tracking for warranty purposes
- Enhanced inventory management
- Better tool identification and organization
